            <p><strong>Shanghai Jiaotong University</strong>, Shanghai, China</p>
            <p><strong>First Author</strong> (Submitted for Publishing), July 2025 – August 2025</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paper title: “Road Sign Classification with a Denoising Pipeline Approach.”</li>
                <li>Used the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset with over 50,000 entries and add Gaussian noise of different severity; used the PyTorch framework to train CNN and ResNet models with clean and noisy datasets. Measured accuracy, latency, and F1 score; innovated a singular classification model and SwinIR denoise-classification pipeline.</li>
                <li>Data suggests that the pipeline approach with CNN significantly improves performance comparable to singular ResNet, whereas the pipeline approach with ResNet weakens performance compared to its singular classification form; investigation ongoing.</li>
                <li>Accepted to the <strong>7th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>ISFA Shuyuan Research Program</strong>, Hong Kong, HK</p>
            <p><strong>First Author</strong> (Published), June 2023 – May 2025</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paper title: “Evaluating the Feasibility of Using Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Aircraft to Replace Helicopters for Rescue Missions.”</li>
                <li>Constructed a VTOL prototype with vertical takeoff, horizontal flight, and stable hover; designed a modular airframe with dual rotating exhaust nozzles using Fusion 360; integrated control systems using an ESP32 microcontroller, gyroscope, and servo motors; VTOL prototype may function as well as a helicopter in short missions, limitations in operation and range, as well as production costs, render it impractical;</li>
                <li>Paper published in Bauhinia Journal, Volume X, Issue 2, Pages 9–21 (ISSN 2409-4064).</li>

            <p><strong>ISFA Shuyuan Research Program</strong>, Hong Kong, HK</p>
            <p><strong>First Author</strong> (Published), April 2023 – December 2024</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Researched “Development and Evaluation of a Low-Cost Open Source Power Monitoring and Recording System for Solar Panel Efficiency Analysis.”</li>
                <li>Used an ESP32 microcontroller, INA219 sensor, and microSD to construct a customizable power monitoring system; conducted a 15-day test at the ISF weather station, comparing results to those of a commercial system; analyzed data using PowerBI, accounting for size and efficiency; found a strong R^2 correlation despite minor discrepancies due to environmental shadows, suggesting high reliability.</li>
                <li>Paper published in IEEE 2023 YE conference: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386508879_Development_and_Evaluation_of_a_Low-Cost_Open_Source_Power_Monitoring_and_Recording_System_for_Solar_Panel_Efficiency_Analysis">Link</a>.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Researched “The Potential of Tracking Solar Panels in Hong Kong Compared to Fixed Panels.”</li>
                <li>Used PowerBI to analyze 3 years of solar panel output data from the ISF Center for Renewable Energy Education; visualized power generation patterns across times of day and seasons using line plots and matrix tables; found that due to shadow interference from Hong Kong skyrises, tracking solar panels only generated 29% more energy than fixed panels; because tracking panels cost 25% more, concluded that fixed arrays offer better ROI.</li>
                <li>Condensed poster presentation published by <strong>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</strong>: <a href="https://agu2022fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=13-4E-8F-0E-A8-42-2E-71-74-37-18-20-F4-AF-E1-CE">Link</a>.</li>
